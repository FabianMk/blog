== Notes

 * Historically, everything was VimL
 * Python integration, remote plugins
 * Lua, it's okay, not much to it
 * Clojure and Lisp are my favs
 * Conjure shows my passion, shame there's so much VimL and Lua
 * Fennel compiles to Lua
 * Replace dotfiles and Conjure VimL / Lua with it
 * Aniseed makes this easy
 * Here's how it works
 * Here's how my dotfiles are architected
